### What I learned
- To use GitHub for features, documenting the pull request, assigning members to review and merging the final result.

### GitHub trick or best practice
- That team members working on the same named file will create a conflict that is difficult to resolve. It would be best if each team member would work on different issues and files.
- In the event that it is necessary to work on the same file, then it would be best that one member works on it at a time, once complete, the next member can proceed.

### Improve teamwork
- That for teamwork, an online meet can be very useful. That way we get everyone together and can resolve the issues faster. We are also able to include the less experienced crafters who gain a lot from the experience of the regular users and also the best practices.
