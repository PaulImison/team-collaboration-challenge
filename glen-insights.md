### What I learned
- I learned how to write suggestions on someone's PR in a GitHub review comment. I did know of the concept, but I don't think I'd actually done it before.
  I usually give (and respond to) suggestions in person, in online meetings, or over messaging platforms.

### GitHub trick or best practice
- It is best practice to scope branches according to what they are for by preceeding the branch name with the scope e.g. `feature/xyz`, or `docs/abc`.

### Improve teamwork
- Online meetings are great for resolving issues and clearing up misunderstandings that other team members may have.
- Having standards and setting them early makes it clear what everyone should do from the get-go, or at the very least, makes everyone ask the right questions.
  This also makes it such that tasks are completed quicker, and this is can online meetings more productive in my opinion. 
  The standrds do not need to be rigid, but they do need to exist.
